# Email Audit

Lightweight email validation and fraud detection library.

## Features

- Email validation: RFC5322 compliance check
- Detects fake or throwaway emails (temporary or high-entropy patterns)
- Identifies role-based or shared inboxes like `info@`, `admin@`, `support@`
- Separator and alias checks
- Checks composition for unnatural or auto-generated addresses
- Lightweight, dependency-free, and fast
- Ideal for user signup validation, form submissions, and anti-fraud systems

## Installation

Via NPM:

```shell
npm install email-audit
```

Via Yarn:

```shell
yarn add email-audit
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import inspect from "email-audit"

const result = inspect("j.o.h.n+ygdfs@gmail.com")

console.log(result)
```

### Output

```shell
{
  suspicious: true,
  threats: [ 
    'email_local_sep_high_density', 
    'email_tag_suspicious' 
  ]
}
```

## Individual Helpers

You can import and run specific checks directly:

```javascript
import {
    validateEmail,
    checkGenericRole,
    checkComposition,
    checkSeparator,
    checkSuspiciousTag,
	checkIfAlias
} from "email-audit"
```

Each helper returns an array of triggered issue codes or an empty array.
